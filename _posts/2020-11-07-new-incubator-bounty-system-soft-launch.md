Hi all!

I'd like to announce the soft launch of the [Dash Incubator App](https://dashincubator.app/).

Dash Incubator lets anyone earn Dash by completing Bounties created in the App.

Get rewarded for [Creating Concepts](https://dashincubator.app/rules#31-concepts), [Writing Specifications](https://dashincubator.app/rules#32-specifications), working on [Projects](https://dashincubator.app/rules#33-projects), [Services](https://dashincubator.app/rules#34-services) or [Jobs](https://dashincubator.app/rules#35-jobs), and [QA](https://dashincubator.app/rules#36-qa)’ing other people’s work.

Everything is incentivized and everything is public, there’s no company or private organization behind the scenes and no decision making behind closed doors.

It’s funded by a series of Dash blockchain-proposals, the latest one went up [today](https://www.dashcentral.org/p/dash-platform-incubator-phase-4).

This is our first version and there’s tons to do, but we’re working hard to improve things, please stay tuned!

Enjoy & Thanks!

Andy Freer
